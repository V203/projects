                            In 1936, the Castle was 
                            declared a National Monument.

                            Today, after land reclamation, the Castle stands almost a kilometre inland in the Central

                        <li>
                            The Castle was built by soldiers, volunteers, 
                            slaves and Khoisan people undergoing punishment

                            The building was designed as the result of a public competition,
